# SeaGrantTautog
The repository for the Tautog project under Sea Grant. This project primarily produces a set of choice data, which involves, for each choice occasion, the attributes of available options and which option is chosen (binary). Specifically, the option attributes (specified as categorical variables) will include a set of Tautog fishing regulation variables (e.g., size limit, daily possession limit, and season length) and a set of expected outcome variables (i.e., fish caught, keepers caught, and lunkers caught). Moreover, demographic data (e.g., age, income, race, and education each classified into a few types) and fishing habit variables (e.g., average fishing days, average fishing days for tautog, fishing aims, perceived regulation enforcement levels, and so on) will also be collected under each participantâ€™s ID number, so that the choices can be linked and explained by demographics and fishing habits while the data is deidentified. 

Three datasets are available in the compressed datafolder. "tautogfinaldata_forsummary.dta" include demographics and angler habits. "tautogfinaldata_foranalysis.dta" is set up for simple choice modeling. "tautogfinaldata_2ndwave.dta" comes from the follow up survey.
